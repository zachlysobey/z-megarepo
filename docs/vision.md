# Vision

This document will provide some aspirational ideas for what I imagine this repository becoming.

## Platform Vision

The z-megarepo is designed to be my personal development platform - a fully scaffolded monorepo that accelerates my ability to create new applications, libraries, and tools.

## Technical Foundation

Everything will be cloud-native, embracing infrastructure-as-code and other "as code" practices for maximum repeatability and automation.

## Project Examples

- Personal mobile app
- Blog platform
- Backstage instance for developer portal
- Scaffolding tools and generators
- Utility libraries
- Software writing and documentation
