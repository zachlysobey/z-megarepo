# Git Conventions

## Branch Naming

### Primary Branch

- **`master`** - The main development branch (not `main`)

### Feature Branches

Right now, there are no explicit conventions for branch naming outside of `master`.

## Workflow

- All changes should be up-to-date with `master`
- Use trunk-based development approach
- One planning branch per user story for longer-term planning
- Use `merge` rather than `squash` or `rebase` when merging PRs.
