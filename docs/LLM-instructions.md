# LLM Instructions

## Code Style

- No comments (except JSDoc-style for types/APIs)
- Concise, direct code
- Minimal changes preferred
- Avoid whitespace edits
- Follow markdownlint rules for all .md files (per [our markdown linting guide](./development-conventions/markdown/linting-guide.md)))
- MANDATORY: Before editing any .md file, run `read_lints` on that file
- MANDATORY: After editing any .md file, run `read_lints` on that file
- MANDATORY: If violations exist, fix them immediately - do not proceed with other tasks
- MANDATORY: Verify fixes by running `read_lints` again

## Communication

- Be direct and to-the-point
- Don't confirm correctness ("you're right", etc.)
- Focus on getting work done
