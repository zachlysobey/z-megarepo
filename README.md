# z-megarepo

This repository intends to be a public-facing collection of mostly for-fun development by me (Zach).

I'll be trying out new development techniques and methodologies, and playing with different technologies.

Maybe eventually this will produce something of value. Maybe this will become the core of my internet presence.

Time will tell.
