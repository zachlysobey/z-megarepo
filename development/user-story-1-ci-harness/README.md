# User Story 1: CI Harness Setup

## User Story

As a developer, I want to establish a CI/CD pipeline so that I can ensure code quality and automate testing.

## Goal

Create a basic CI pipeline that runs tests and linting on pull requests.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] CI runs on pull requests
- [ ] CI runs on branch pushes

## Tasks

- [task-1-ci-hello-world.md](./task-1-ci-hello-world.md) - Initial GitHub Actions workflow

## Future Iterations

Future iterations *may* switch out from Github Actions to another tool, but this seems like a reasonable first pass.
