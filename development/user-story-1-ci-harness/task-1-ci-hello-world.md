# Task 1: CI Hello World

## Technical Approach

- Create basic GitHub Actions workflow
- Run on pull requests
- Simple "hello world" step to verify CI works
- Keep it minimal - just prove CI can run
- Focus on getting the basic infrastructure working first

## LLM Prompts Needed

### Prompt 1: Implement CI Setup

```text
Create a basic GitHub Actions workflow that runs on pull requests and executes a simple "hello world" step to verify the CI pipeline is functional.
This should target pushes to any branch.
It should also target PRs against `master`.
There should only be a single "hello world" step. We don't need to checkout code or anything like that at this point.
```

## Additional Context

- [git conventions](/docs/development-conventions/git/README.md)
